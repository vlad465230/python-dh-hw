and crook a though it have be break at least twice this name wa albus dumbledore albus dumbledore seem to realize that he have just arrive in a street where everything from his name to his boot wa unwelcome he wa busy rummage in his cloak look for something but he do seem to realize he wa be watch because he look up suddenly at the cat which wa still star at him from the other end of the street for some reason the sight of the cat seem to amuse him he chuckle and mutter i should have know he find what he wa look for in his inside pocket it seem to be a silver cigarette lighter he flick it open hold it up in the air and click it the nearest street lamp go out with a little pop he click it next lamp flicker into darkness twelve time he click the until the only light leave on the whole street be two tiny pinprick in the distance which be the eye of the cat watch him if anyone look out of their window now even mr dursley they be able to see anything that wa happen down on the pavement dumbledore slip the back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sit down on the wall next to the cat he look at it but after a moment he speak to it fancy see you here professor mcgonagall he turn to smile at the tabby but it have go instead he wa smile at a rather woman who wa wear square glass exactly the shape of the mark the cat have have around it eye she too wa wear a cloak an emerald one her black hair wa drawn into a tight bun she look distinctly ruffle how do you know it wa me she ask my dear professor i ve never see a cat sit so stiffly be

to celebrate for eleven year i know that say professor mcgonagall irritably but no reason to lose our head people be be downright careless out on the street in broad daylight not even dress in muggle clothes swap rumor she throw a sharp sideways glance at dumbledore here a though hoping he wa go to tell her something but he so she go on a fine thing it would be if on the very day seem to have disappear at last the muggles find out about u all i suppose he really ha go dumbledore it certainly seem so say dumbledore we have much to be thankful for would you care for a lemon drop a what a

sensible person like yourself can call him by his name all this eleven year i have be try to persuade people to call him by his proper voldemort professor mcgonagall flinch but dumbledore who wa unsticking two lemon drop seem not to notice it all get so confusing if we keep say i have never see any reason to be frighten of say name i know you haven t say professor mcgonagall sound half exasperate half admire but different everyone know the only one all right voldemort wa frighten of you flatter me say dumbledore calmly voldemort have power i will never have only because to use them lucky dark i blush so much since madam pomfrey tell me she like my new earmuff professor mcgonagall shoot a sharp look at dumbledore and say the owl be nothing next to the rumor that be fly around you know what say about why disappear about what finally stop him it seem that professor mcgonagall have reach the point she wa most anxious to discus the real reason she have be wait on a cold hard wall all day for neither a a cat nor a a woman have she fix dumbledore with such a piercing stare a she do now it wa plain that whatever everyone wa say she wa not go to believe it until dumbledore tell her it wa true dumbledore however wa choose another lemon drop and do not answer what say she press on be that last night voldemort turn up in hollow he go to find the potter the rumor be that lily

top of his glass it would be enough to turn any head famous before he can walk and talk famous for something he even remember cara you see how much better off be grow up away from all that until ready

and now bedtime off you trot the gryffindor first year follow percy through the chattering crowd out of the great hall and up the marble staircase leg be like lead again but only because he wa so tired and full of food he wa too sleepy even to be surprise that the people in the portrait along the corridor whisper and point a they pass or that twice percy lead them through doorway hide behind slide panel and hang tapestry they climb more staircase yawning and drag their foot and harry wa just wonder how much farther they have to go when they come to a sudden halt a bundle of walk stick wa float in midair ahead of them and a percy take a step toward them they start throw themselves at him peeve percy whisper to the first year a poltergeist he raise his voice yourself a loud rude sound like the air be let out of a balloon answer do you want me to go to the bloody baron there wa a pop and a little man with wicked dark eye and a wide mouth appear float crosslegged in the air clutch the walk stick oooooooh he say with an evil cackle ickle firsties what fun he swoop suddenly at them they all duck go away peeve or the hear about this i mean it bark percy peeve stick out his tongue and vanish drop the walk stick on head they hear him zoom away rattle coat of armor a he pass you want to watch out for peeve say percy a they set off again the bloody the only one who can control him he even listen to u prefect here we be at the very end of the corridor hang a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress password she say caput draconis say percy and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall they all scramble through need a leg find themselves in the gryffindor common room a cozy round room full of squashy armchair percy direct the girl through one door to their dormitory and the boy through another at the top of a spiral be obviously in one of the find their bed at five hung with deep red velvet curtain their trunk have already be bring up too tire to talk much they pull on their pajama and fell into bed great food it ron mutter to harry through the hang get off scabbers chew my sheet harry wa go to ask ron if have any of the treacle tart but he fell asleep almost at once perhaps harry have eat a bit too much because he have a very strange dream he wa wear professor turban which keep talk to him tell him he must transfer to slytherin at once because it wa his destiny harry tell the turban he want to be in it get heavier and he try to pull it off but it tighten there wa malfoy laugh at him a he struggle with it then malfoy turn into the teacher snape whose laugh become high and wa a burst of green light and harry wake sweat and shake he roll over and fell asleep again and when he wake next day he remember the dream at all chapter eight the potion master there look where next to the tall kid with the red hair wear the glass do you see his face do you see his scar whisper follow harry from the moment he leave his dormitory the next day people line up outside classroom stand on tiptoe to get a look at him or double back to pas him in the corridor again star harry wish they because he wa try to concentrate on find his way to class there be a hundred and staircase at wide sweeping narrow rickety some that lead somewhere different on a some with a vanish step halfway up that you have to remember to jump then there be door that open unless you ask politely or tickle them in exactly the right place and door that really door at all but solid wall just pretend it wa also very hard to remember where anything wa because it all seem to move around a lot the people in the portrait keep go to visit each other and harry wa sure the coat of armor could walk the ghost help either it wa always a nasty shock when one of them glide suddenly through a door you be try to open nearly headless nick wa always happy to point new gryffindors in the right direction but peeve the poltergeist wa worth two locked door and a trick staircase if you meet him when you be late for class he would drop wastepaper basket on your head pull rug from under your foot pelt you with bit of chalk or sneak up behind you invisible grab your nose and screech get your conk even worse than peeve if that wa possible wa the caretaker argus filch harry and ron manage to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning filch find them try to force their way through a door that unluckily turn out to be the entrance to the corridor on the third floor he believe they be lose wa sure they be try to break into it on purpose and wa threaten to lock them in the dungeon when they be rescue by professor quirrell who wa pass filch own a cat call mr norris a scrawny creature with bulge lamp like eye just like she patrol the corridor alone break a rule in front of her put just one toe out of line and whisk off for filch appear wheeze two second later filch know the secret passageway of the school better than anyone perhaps the weasley and could pop up a suddenly a any of the ghost the student all hat him and it wa the dearest ambition of many to give mr norris a good kick and then once you have manage to find them there be the class themselves there wa a lot more to magic a harry quickly find out than wave your wand and say a few funny word they have to study the night sky through their telescope every wednesday at midnight and learn the name of different star and the movement of the planet three time a week they go out to the greenhouse behind the castle to study herbology with a dumpy little witch call professor sprout where they learn how to take care of all the strange plant and fungi and find out what they be use for easily the most boring class wa history of magic which wa the only one taught by a ghost professor binns have be very old indeed when he have fall asleep in front of the staff room fire and get up next morning to teach leave his body behind him binns drone on and on while they scribble down name and date and get emetic the evil and uric the oddball mix up professor flitwick the charm teacher wa a tiny little wizard who have to stand on a pile of book to see over his desk at the start of their first class he take the roll call and when he reach name he give an excited squeak and topple out of sight professor mcgonagall wa again different harry have be quite right to think she a teacher to cross strict and clever she give them a the moment they sit down in her first class transfiguration be some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts she say anyone mess around in my class will leave and not come back you have be warn then she change her desk into a pig and back again they be all very impressed and wait to get start but soon realize they go to be change the furniture into animal for a long time after take a lot of complicate note they be each give a match and start try to turn it into a needle by the end of the lesson only hermione granger have make any difference to her professor mcgonagall show the class how it have go all silver and pointy and give hermione a rare smile the class everyone have really be look forward to wa defense against the dark art but lesson turn out to be a bit of a joke his classroom smell strongly of garlic which everyone say wa to ward off a vampire meet in romania and wa afraid would be come back to get him one of these day his turban he tell them have be give to him by an african prince a a for get rid of a troublesome zombie but they sure they believe this story for one thing when seamus finnigan ask eagerly to hear how quirrell have fight off the zombie quirrell go pink and start talk about the for another they have notice that a funny smell hung around the turban and the weasley twin insist that it wa stuffed full of garlic a well so that quirrell wa protect wherever he go harry wa very relieved to find out that he mile behind everyone else lot of people have come from muggle family and like him have any idea that they be witch and wizard there wa so much to learn that even people like ron have much of a head start friday wa an important day for harry and ron

potion lesson he know be wrong snape dislike hat him potion lesson take place down in one of the dungeon it wa colder here than up in the main castle and would have be quite creepy enough without the pickle animal float in glass jar all around the wall snape like flitwick start the class by take the roll call and like flitwick he pause at name ah yes he say softly harry potter our draco malfoy and his friend crabbe and goyle snigger behind their hand snape finish call the name and look up at the class his eye be black like but they have none of warmth they be cold and empty and make you think of dark tunnel you be here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking he begin he speak in barely more than a whisper but they catch every professor mcgonagall snape have y catch every professor mcgonagall snape have the gift of keep a class silent without effort a there be little foolish here many of you will hardly believe this be magic i expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmer cauldron with it shimmer fume the delicate power of liquid that creep through human vein bewitch the mind ensnare the sen i can teach you how to bottle fame brew glory even stopper you a big a bunch of dunderhead a i usually have to teach more silence follow this little speech harry and ron exchange look with raise eyebrow hermione granger wa on the edge of her seat and look desperate to start prove that she a dunderhead potter say snape suddenly what would i get if i add powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood powder root of what to an infusion of what harry glance at ron who look a stump a he hand have shoot into the air i know sit say harry lip curl into a sneer tut clearly everything he ignore hand try again potter where would you look if i tell you to find me a bezoar hermione stretch her hand a high into the air a it would go without her leave her seat but harry have the faintest idea what a bezoar wa he try not to look at malfoy crabbe and goyle who be shake with laughter i know sit thought you open a book before coming eh potter harry force himself to keep look straight into those cold eye he have look through his book at the dursleys but do snape expect him to remember everything in one thousand magical herb and fungi snape wa still ignore quiver hand what be the difference potter between monkshood and wolfsbane at this hermione stand up her hand stretch toward the dungeon ceiling i know say harry quietly i think hermione doe though why you try her a few people harry catch eye and seamus wink snape however wa not pleased sit

and it will save you from most poison a for monkshood and wolfsbane they be the same plant which also go by the name of aconite well why you all copy that down there wa a sudden rummaging for quill and parchment over the noise snape say and a point will be take from gryffindor house for your cheek potter thing improve for the gryffindors a the potion lesson continue snape put them all into pair and set them to mix up a simple potion to cure boil he sweep around in his long black cloak watch them weigh dry nettle and crush snake fang criticize almost everyone except malfoy whom he seem to like he wa just tell everyone to look at the perfect way malfoy have stew his horn slug when cloud of acid green smoke and a loud hissing fill the dungeon neville have somehow manage to melt cauldron into a twisted blob and their potion wa seep across the stone floor burn hole in shoe within second the whole class wa stand on their stool while neville who have be drench in the potion when the cauldron collapse moan in pain a angry red boil spring up all over his arm and leg idiot boy snarl snape clear the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand i suppose you add the porcupine quill before take the cauldron off the fire neville whimper a boil start to pop up all over his nose take him up to the hospital wing snape spat at seamus then he round on harry and ron who have be work next to neville you tell him not to add the quill think make you look good if he get it wrong do you another point lose for gryffindor this wa so unfair that harry open his mouth to argue but ron kick him behind their cauldron doipush it he mutter heard snape can turn very nasty a they climb the step out of the dungeon an hour later mind wa racing and his spirit be low lose two point for gryffindor in his very first do snape hate him so much cheer up say ron always take point off fred and george can i come and meet hagrid with you at five to three they leave the castle and make their way across

along corridor strip with bar of moonlight from the high window at every turn harry expect to run into filch or mr norris but they be lucky they speed up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room malfoy and crabbe there yet the crystal trophy case glimmer where the moonlight catch them cup shield plate and statue wink silver and gold in the darkness they edge along the wall keep their eye on the door at either end of the room harry take out his wand in case malfoy leapt in and start at once the minute crept by late maybe chickened out ron whisper then a noise in the next room make them jump harry have only just raise his wand when they hear someone speak and it malfoy sniff around my sweet they might be lurk in a corner it wa filch speak to mr norris harry wave madly at the other three to follow him a quickly a they scurry silently toward the door away from voice robe have barely whip round the corner when they hear filch enter the trophy room in here somewhere they hear him mutter probably hide this way harry mouth to the others and petrify they begin to creep down a long gallery full of suit of armor they could hear filch get nearer neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and break into a run he trip grabbed ron around the waist and the pair of them topple right into a suit of armor the clanging and crashing be enough to wake the whole castle run harry yell and the four of them sprint down the gallery not look back to see whether filch wa swung around the doorpost and gallop down one corridor then another harry in the lead without any idea where they be or where they be rip through a tapestry and find themselves in a hidden passageway hurtle along it and come out near their charm classroom which they know wa mile from the trophy room i think lose him harry pant lean against the cold wall and wipe his forehead neville wa bent double wheezing and splutter you hermione gasped clutching at the stitch in her chest get

minute what harry turn saw quite clearly what for a moment he wa sure walk into a wa too much on top of everything that have happen so far they in a room a he have suppose they be in a corridor the forbidden corridor on the third floor and now they know why it wa forbidden they be look straight into the eye of a monstrous dog a dog that fill the whole space between ceiling and floor it have three head three pair of roll mad three nose twitch and quiver in their three drool mouth saliva hang in slippery rope from yellowish fang it wa stand quite still all six eye star at them and harry know that the only reason they already dead wa that their sudden appearance have take it by surprise but it wa quickly get over that there wa no mistake what those thunderous growl meant harry grope for the filch and death take filch they fell slam the door shut and they run they almost fly back down the corridor filch must have hurry off to look for them somewhere else because they see him anywhere but they hardly they want to do wa put a much space a possible between them and that monster they stop run until they reach the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh floor where on earth have you all be she ask look at their bathrobe hang off their shoulder and their flush sweaty face never mind snout pig snout pant harry and the portrait swung forward they scramble into the common room and collapsed trembling into armchair it wa a while before any of them say anything neville indeed look a if never speak again what do they think do keep a thing like that lock up in a school say ron finally if any dog need exercise that one doe hermione have get both her breath and her bad temper back again you use your eye any of you do you she snap you see what it wa stand on the floor harry suggest i look at it foot i wa too busy with it head no not the floor it wa stand on a trapdoor obviously guard something she stand up glare at them i hope pleased with yourselves we could all have be worse expel now if you mind go to bed ron star after her his mouth open no we mind he say think we drag her along you but hermione have give harry something else to think about a he climb back into bed the dog wa guard something what have hagrid say gringotts wa the safest place in the world for something you want to perhaps hogwarts it look a though harry have find out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen wa chapter ten halloween malfoy believe his eye when he saw that harry and ron be still at hogwarts the next day look tire but perfectly cheerful indeed by the next morning harry and ron think that meet the dog have be an excellent adventure and they be quite keen to have another one in the meantime harry fill ron in about the package that seem to have be move from gringotts to hogwarts and they spend a lot of time wonder what could possibly need such heavy protection either really valuable or really dangerous say ron or both say harry but a all they know for sure about the mysterious object wa that it wa about two inch long they have much chance of guess what it wa without further clue neither neville nor hermione show the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor all neville care about wa never go near the dog again hermione wa now refuse to speak to harry and ron but she wa such a bossy that they saw this a an added bonus all they really want now wa a way of get back at malfoy and to their great delight just such a thing arrive in the mail about a week later a the owl flood into the great hall a usual attention wa catch at once by a long thin package carry by six large screech owl harry wa just a interested a everyone else to see what wa in this large parcel and wa amaze when the owl soar down and drop it right in front of him knock his bacon to the floor they have hardly flutter out of the way when another owl drop a letter on top of the parcel harry rip open the letter first which wa lucky because it do not open the parcel at the table it contain your new nimbus two thousand but i want everybody know get a broomstick or all want one oliver wood will meet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven for your first training session professor mcgonagall harry have difficulty hide his glee a he hand the note to ron to read a nimbus two thousand ron moan enviously never even touch one they leave the hall quickly want to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class but halfway across the entrance hall they find the way upstairs bar by crabbe and goyle malfoy seize the package from harry and felt it a broomstick he say throw it back to harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face be in for it this time potter first year allow them ron resist it not any old broomstick he say a nimbus two thousand what do you say get at home malfoy a comet two sixty ron grin at harry comet look flashy but not in the same league a the nimbus what would you know about it weasley you afford half the handle malfoy snap back i suppose you and your brother have to save up twig by twig before ron could answer professor flitwick appear at elbow not argue i hope boy he squeak be send a broomstick professor say malfoy quickly yes yes right say professor flitwick beaming at harry professor mcgonagall tell me all about the special circumstance potter and what model be it a nimbus two thousand sit say harry fight not to laugh at the look of horror on face and really thanks to malfoy here that get it he add harry and ron head upstairs smother their laughter at obvious rage and confusion well true harry chortle a they reach the top of the marble staircase if he steal remembrall i be on the team so i suppose you think a reward for break rule come an angry voice from just behind them hermione wa stomp up the stair look disapprovingly at the package in hand i think you speak to u say harry yes stop now say ron do u so much good hermione march away with her nose in the air harry have a lot of trouble keep his mind on his lesson that day it keep wander up to the dormitory where his new broomstick wa lie under his bed or stray off to the quidditch field where be learn to play that night he bolt his dinner that even without notice what he wa eat and then rush upstairs with ron to unwrap the nimbus two thousand at last wow ron sigh a the broomstick roll onto bedspread even harry who know nothing about the different broom think it look wonderful sleek and shiny with a mahogany handle it have a long tail of neat straight twig and nimbus two thousand write in gold near the top a seven draw nearer harry leave the castle and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field hold never be inside the stadium before hundred of seat be raise in stand around the field so that the spectator be high enough to see what wa go on at either end of the field be three golden pole with hoop on the end they remind harry of the little plastic stick muggle child blow bubble through except that they be fifty foot high too eager to fly again to wait for wood harry mount his broomstick and kick off from the ground what a swoop in and out of the goal post and then speed up and down the field the nimbus two thousand turn wherever he want at his lightest touch hey potter come down oliver wood have arrive fie wa carry a large wooden crate under his arm harry land next to him very nice say wood his eye glinting i see what mcgonagall meant you really be a natural just go to teach you the rule this evening then be join team practice three time a week he open the crate inside be four ball right say wood now quidditch be easy enough to understand even if not too easy to play there be seven player on each side three of them be call chaser three chaser harry repeat a wood take out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball this call the quaffle say wood the chaser throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoop to score a goal ten point every time the quaffle go through one of the hoop follow me the chaser throw the quaffle and put it through the hoop to score harry recite sort of like basketball on broomstick with six hoop it basketball say wood curiously never mind say harry quickly now another player on each side call the keeper keeper for gryffindor i have to fly around our hoop and stop the other team from score three chaser one keeper say harry who wa determine to remember it all and they play with the quaffle okay get that so what be they for he point at the three ball leave inside the box show you now say wood take this he hand harry a small club a bit like a short baseball bat go to show you what the bludgers do wood say these two be the bludgers he show harry two identical ball jet black and slightly smaller than the red quaffle harry notice that they seem to be strain to escape the strap hold them inside the box stand back wood warn harry he bend down and free one of the bludgers at once the black ball rise high in the air and then pelt straight at face harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from break his nose and send it zigzag away into the zoom around their head and then shot at wood who dive on top of it and manage to pin it to the ground see wood pant force the struggle bludger back into the crate and strap it down safely the bludgers rocket around try to knock player off their broom why you have two beater on each weasley twin be their job to protect their side from the bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team get all that three chaser try and score with the the keeper guard the goal the beater keep the bludgers away from their team harry reel off very good say wood the bludgers ever kill anyone harry ask hop he sound offhand never at hogwarts have a couple of broken jaw but nothing worse than that now the last member of the team be the seeker you and you have to worry about the quaffle or the bludgers unless they crack my head open worry the weasleys be more than a match for the mean like a pair of human bludgers themselves wood reach into the crate and take out the fourth and last ball compare with the quaffle and the bludgers it wa tiny about the size of a large walnut it wa bright gold and have little fluttering silver wing this say wood be the golden snitch and the most important ball of the lot very hard to catch because so fast and difficult to see the job to catch it get to weave in and out of the chaser beater bludgers and quaffle to get it before the other seeker because whichever seeker catch the snitch win his team an extra hundred and fifty point so they nearly always win why seeker get foul so much a game of quidditch only end when the snitch be catch so it can go on for think the record be three month they have to keep bringing on substitute so the player could get some sleep well question harry shake his head he understand what he have to do all right it wa do it that wa go to be the problem we practice with the snitch yet say wood carefully shut it back inside the crate too dark we might lose it try you out with a few of these he pull a bag of ordinary golf ball out of his pocket and a few minute later he and harry be up in the air wood throw the golf ball a hard a he could in every direction for harry to catch harry miss a single one and wood wa delight after half an hour night have really fall and they carry on that quidditch have our name on it this year say wood happily a they trudge back up to the castle i be surprise if you turn out better than charlie weasley and he could have play for england if he go off chase dragon perhaps it wa because he wa now so busy what with quidditch practice three even a week on top of all his homework but harry could hardly believe it when he realize that already be at hogwarts two month the castle felt more like home than privet drive ever have his lesson too be become more and more interesting now that they have master the basic on halloween morning they wake to the delicious smell of bake pumpkin waft through the corridor even better professor flitwick announce in charm that he think they be ready to start make object fly something they have all be die to try since see him make toad zoom around the classroom professor flitwick put the class into pair to practice partner wa seamus finnigan wa a relief because neville have be try to catch his ron however wa to be work with hermione granger it wa hard to tell whether ron or hermione wa angrier about this she speak to either of them since the day broomstick have arrive now forget that nice wrist movement be practice squeak professor flitwick perch on top of his pile of book a usual swish and flick remember swish and flick and say the magic word properly be very important forget wizard baruffio who say s instead of f and find himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest it wa very difficult harry and seamus swish and flick but the feather they be suppose to be send skyward just lay on the desktop seamus get so impatient that he prod it with his wand and set fire to have to put it out with his hat ron at the next table have much more luck wingardium leviosa he shout wave his long arm like a windmill say it wrong harry heard hermione snap make the gar nice and long you do it then if so clever ron snarl hermione roll up the sleeve of her gown flick her wand and say wingardium leviosa their feather rise off the desk and hover about four foot above their head oh well do cry professor flitwick clap everyone see here miss do it ron wa in a very bad mood by the end of the class no wonder no one can stand her he say to harry a they push their way into the crowd corridor a nightmare honestly someone knock into harry a they hurry past him it wa hermione harry catch a glimpse of her wa startle to see that she wa in tear i think she hear you so say ron but he look a bit uncomfortable she notice get no friend hermione turn up for the next class and see all afternoon on their way down to the great hall for the halloween feast harry and ron overheard parvati patil tell her friend lavender that hermione wa cry in the girl bathroom and want to be leave alone ron look still more awkward at this but a moment later they have enter the great hall where the halloween decoration put hermione out of their mind a thousand live bat flutter from the wall and ceiling while a thousand more swoop over the table in low black cloud make the candle in the pumpkin stutter the feast appear suddenly on the golden plate a it have at the banquet harry wa just help himself to a bake potato when professor quirrell come sprint into the hall his turban askew and terror on his face everyone star a he reach professor chair slump against the table and gasp the you ought to know he then sink to the floor in a dead faint there wa an uproar it take several purple firecracker explode from the end of professor wand to bring silence prefect he rumble lead your house back to the dormitory immediately percy wa in his element follow me stick together first year no need to fear the troll if you follow my order stay close behind me now make way first year come through excuse me a prefect how could a troll get in harry ask a they climb the stair ask me suppose to be really stupid say ron maybe peeve let it in for a halloween joke they pass different group of people hurry in different direction a they jostle their way through a crowd of confused hufflepuffs harry suddenly grab arm just what about her she know about the troll ron bite his lip oh all right he snap but better not see u duck down they join the hufflepuffs go the other way slip down a deserted side corridor and hurry off toward the girl bathroom they have just turn the corner when they hear quick footstep behind them percy hissed ron pulling harry behind a large stone griffin peer around it however they saw not percy but snape he cross the corridor and disappear from view he do harry whisper why he down in the dungeon with the rest of the teacher search me quietly a possible they creep along the next corridor after fade footstep head for the third floor harry say but ron hold up his hand can you smell something harry sniff and a foul stench reach his nostril a mixture of old sock and the kind of public toilet no one seem to clean and then they hear low grunting and the shuffle footfall of gigantic foot ron the end of a passage to the left something huge wa move toward them they shrink into the shadow and watch a it emerge into a patch of moonlight it wa a horrible sight twelve foot tall it skin wa a dull granite gray it great lumpy body like a boulder with it small bald head perch on top like a coconut it have short leg thick a tree trunk with flat horny foot the smell come from it wa incredible it wa hold a huge wooden club which drag along the floor because it arm be so long the troll stop next to a doorway and peer inside it waggle it long ear make up it tiny mind then slouch slowly into the room the key in the lock harry mutter we could lock it in good idea say ron nervously they edge toward the open door mouth dry pray the troll about to come out of it with one great leap harry manage to grab the key slam the door and lock it yes flush with their victory they start to run back up the passage but a they reach the corner they hear something that make their heart high petrify it wa come from the chamber just chain up oh no say ron pale a the bloody baron the girl bathroom harry gasp hermione they say together it wa the last thing they want to do but what choice do they have wheel around they sprint back to the door and turn the key fumbling in their panic harry pull the door open and they run inside hermione granger wa shrink against the wall opposite look a if she wa about to faint the troll wa advance on her knock the sink off the wall a it go confuse it harry say desperately to ron and seize a tap he throw it a hard a he could against the wall the troll stop a few foot from hermione it lumber around blink stupidly to see what have make the noise it mean little eye saw harry it hesitate then make for him instead lift it club a it go oy yell ron from the other side of the chamber and he throw a metal pipe at it the troll even seem to notice the pipe hit it shoulder but it hear the yell and pause again turn it ugly snout toward ron instead give harry time to run around it come on run run harry yell at hermione try to pull her toward the door but she move she wa still flat against the wall her mouth open with terror the shouting and the echo seem to be drive the troll berserk it roar again and start toward ron who wa nearest and have no way to escape harry then do something that wa both very brave and very he take a great running jump and manage to fasten his arm around the neck from behind the troll feel harry hang there but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up it nose and wand have still be in his hand when have go straight up one of the nostril howling with pain the troll twist and flail it club with harry cling on for dear any second the troll wa go to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club hermione have sink to the floor in ron pull out his own knowing what he wa go to do he hear himself cry the first spell that come into his wingardium leviosa the club fly suddenly out of the hand rise high high up into the air turn slowly drop with a sicken crack onto it head the troll sway on the spot and then fell flat on it face with a thud that make the whole room tremble harry get to his foot he wa shake and out of breath ron wa stand there with his wand still raise star at what he have do it wa hermione who speak first be i think so say harry i think just be knock out he bend down and pull his wand out of the nose it wa cover in what look like lumpy gray glue booger he wipe it on the trouser a sudden slamming and loud footstep make the three of them look up they realize what a racket they have be make but of course someone downstairs must have hear the crash and the roar a moment later professor mcgonagall have come bursting into the room closely follow by snape with quirrell bring up the rear quirrell take one look at the troll let out a faint whimper and sit quickly down on a toilet clutch his heart snape bent over the troll professor mcgonagall wa look at ron and harry harry have never see her look so angry her lip be white hope of win fifty point for gryffindor fade quickly from mind what on earth be you thinking of say professor mcgonagall with cold fury in her voice harry look at ron who wa still stand with his wand in the air lucky you kill why you in your dormitory snape give harry a swift piercing look

really lucky that harry now have hermlone a a friend he know how have get through all his homework without her what with all the quidditch practice wood wa make them do she have also tent him quidditch through the age which turn out to be a very interesting read harry learn that there be seven hundred way of commit a quidditch foul and that all of them have happen during a world cup match in that seeker be usually the smallest and fastest player and that most serious quidditch accident seem to happen to that although people rarely die play quidditch referee have be know to vanish and turn up month later in the sahara desert hermione have become a bit more relaxed about break rule since harry and ron have save her from the mountain troll and she wa much nicer for it the day before

of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him fell asleep almost a soon a drawn the curtain of his harry lean over the side of his own bed and pull the cloak out from under it his this have be his he let the material flow over his hand smoother than silk light a air use it well the note have say he have to try it now he slip out of bed and wrap the cloak around himself look down at his leg he saw only moonlight and shadow it wa a very funny feeling use it well suddenly harry felt the whole of hogwarts wa open to him in this cloak excitement flood through him a he stand there in the dark and silence he could go anywhere in this anywhere and filch would never know ron grunt in his sleep should harry wake him something hold him felt that this first want to use it alone he creep out of the dormitory down the stair across the common room and climb through the portrait hole there squawk the fat lady harry say nothing he walk quickly down the corridor where should he go he stop his heart racing and thought and then it come to him the restrict section in the library be able to read a long a he like a long a it take to find out who flamel wa he set off draw the invisibility cloak tight around him a he walk the library wa and very eerie harry light a lamp to see his way along the row of book the lamp look a if it wa float along in midair and even though harry could feel his arm support it the sight give him the creep the restrict section wa right at the back of the library step ping carefully over the rope that separate these book from the rest of the library he hold up his lamp to read the title they tell him much their peeling fade gold letter spell word in language harry understand some have no title at all one book have a dark stain on it that look horribly like blood the hair on the back of neck prickle maybe he wa imagine it maybe not but he think a faint whisper wa come from the book a though they know someone wa there who be he have to start somewhere set the lamp down carefully on the floor he look along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book a large black and silver volume catch his eye he pull it out with difficulty because it wa very heavy and balance it on his knee let it fall open a pierce bloodcurdling shriek split the book wa scream harry snap it shut but the shriek go on and on one high unbroken earsplitting note he stumble backward and knock over his lamp which go out at once panic he hear footstep come down the corridor the shriek book back on the shelf he run for it he pass filch in the pale wild eye look straight through him and harry slip under outstretched arm and streak off up the corridor the shriek still ring in his ear he come to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor he have be so busy get away from the library he pay attention to where he wa go perhaps because it wa dark he recognize where he wa at all there wa a suit of armor near the kitchen he know but he must be five floor above there you ask me to come directly to you professor if anyone wa wander around at night and be in the library restrict section harry felt the blood drain out of his face wherever he wa filch must know a shortcut because his soft greasy voice wa get nearer and to his horror it wa snape who reply the restricted section well they be far catch them harry stood root to the spot a filch and snape come around the corner ahead they see him of course but it wa a narrow corridor and if they come much nearer knock right into cloak stop him from be solid he back away a quietly a he could a door stand ajar to his left it wa his only hope he squeeze through it hold his breath try not to move it and to his relief he manage to get inside the room without their noticing anything they walk straight past and harry lean against the wall breathing deeply listen to their footstep die away that have be close very close it wa a few second before he notice anything about the room he have hide in it look like an unused classroom the dark shape of desk and chair be pile against the wall and there wa an upturned wastepaper prop against the wall face him wa something that look a if it belong there something that look a if someone have just put it there to keep it out of the way it wa a magnificent mirror a high a the ceiling with an ornate gold frame stand on two clawed foot there wa an inscription carve around the erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi his panic fading now that there wa no sound of filch and snape harry move nearer to the mirror want to look at himself but see no reflection again he step in front of it he have to clap his hand to his mouth to stop himself from scream he whirl around his heart wa pound far more furiously than when the book have he have see not only himself in the mirror but a whole crowd of people stand right behind him but the room wa empty breathe very fast he turn slowly back to the mirror there he wa reflect in it white and and there reflect behind him be at least ten others harry look over his still no one wa there or be they all invisible too wa he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this trick wa that it reflect them invisible or not he look in the mirror again a woman stand right behind his reflection wa smile at him and wave he reach out a hand and felt the air behind him if she wa really there touch her their reflection be so close together but he felt only and the others exist only in the mirror she wa a very pretty woman she have dark red hair and her eye be just like mine harry think edge a little closer to the glass bright the same shape but then he notice that she wa smile but cry at the same time the tall thin man stand next to her put his arm around her he wear glass and his hair wa very untidy it stick up at the back just a do harry wa so close to the mirror now that his nose wa nearly touch that of his reflection mom he whisper dad they just look at him smile and slowly harry look into the face of the other people in the mirror and saw other pair of green eye like his other nose like his even a little old man who look a though he have knobbly wa look at his family for the first time in his life the potter smile and wave at harry and he star hungrily back at them his hand press flat against the glass a though he wa hop to fall right through it and reach them he have a powerful kind of ache inside him half joy half terrible sadness how long he stand there he know the reflection do not fade and he look and look until a distant noise bring him back to his sen he stay here he have to find his way back to bed he tear his eye away from his face whisper come back and hurry from the room you could have wake me up say ron crossly you can come tonight go back i

excuse to knock point off gryffindor george weasley really do fall off his broom at these word refereeing he splutter through a mouthful of mud he ever referee a quidditch match not go to be fair if we might overtake slytherin the rest of the team land next to george to complain too not my fault say wood just get to make sure we play a clean game so snape get an excuse to pick on u which wa all very well think harry but he have another reason for not want snape near him while he wa play quidditch the rest of the team hang back to talk to one another a usual at the end of practice but harry head straight back to the gryffindor common room where he find ron and hermione playing chess chess wa the only thing hermione ever lose at something harry and ron thought wa very good for her talk to me for a moment say ron when harry sit down next to him i need to concen he catch sight of face the matter with you you look terrible speaking quietly so that no one else would hear harry tell the other two about sudden sinister desire to be a quidditch referee play say hermione at once say ill say ron pretend to break your leg hermione suggest really break your leg say ron i say harry there a reserve seeker if i back out gryffindor play at all at that moment neville topple into the common room how he have manage to climb through the portrait hole wa guess because his leg have be stick together with what they recognize at once a the curse he must have have to bunny hop all the way up to gryffindor tower everyone fell over laugh except hermione who leap up and perform the countercurse leg spring apart and he get to his foot tremble what happen hermione ask him lead him over to sit with harry and ron malfoy say neville shakily i meet him outside the library he say be look for someone to practice that on go to professor mcgonagall hermione urge neville report him neville shake his head i want more trouble he mumble get to stand up to him neville say ron use to walk all over people but no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier no need to tell me not brave enough to be in gryffindor already do that neville choke out harry felt in the pocket of his robe and pull out a chocolate frog the very last one from the box hermione have give him for christmas he give it to neville who look a though he might cry worth twelve of malfoy harry say the sort hat choose you for gryffindor it and malfoy in stink slytherin lip twitch in a weak smile a he unwrap the frog thanks harry i think go to bed want the card you collect them you a neville walk away harry look at the famous wizard card dumbledore again he say he wa the first one i ever he gasp he star at the back of the card then he look up at ron and hermione find him he whisper found flamel i

quiet life in devon with his wife perenelle hundred and see say hermione when harry and ron have finish the dog must be guard stone i bet he ask dumbledore to keep it safe for him because friend and he know someone wa after it why he want the stone move out of gringotts a stone that make gold and stop you from ever die say harry no wonder after it anyone would want it and no wonder we find flamel in that study of recent development in wizardry say ron not exactly recent if six hundred and be he the next morning in defense against the dark art while copy down different way of treat werewolf bite harry and ron be still discuss what do with a stone if they have one it until ron say buy his own quidditch team that harry remember about snape and the come match go to play he tell ron and hermione if i all the slytherins will think just too scared to face snape show them really wipe the smile off their face if we win just a long a not wipe you off the field say hermione a the match draw nearer however harry become more and more nervous whatever he tell ron and hermione the rest of the team too calm either the idea of overtake slytherin in the house championship wa wonderful no one have do it for seven year but would they be allow to with such a biased referee harry know whether he wa imagine it or not but he seem to keep run into snape wherever he go at time he even wonder whether snape wa follow him try to catch him on his own potion lesson be turn into a sort of weekly torture snape wa so horrible to harry could snape possibly know find out about the stone harry see how he he sometimes have the horrible feeling that snape could read mind harry knew when they wish him good luck outside the locker room the next afternoon that ron and hermione be wonder whether ever see him alive again this what call comfort harry hardly hear a word of pep talk a he pull on his quidditch robe and pick up his nimbus two thousand ron and hermione meanwhile have find a place in the stand next to neville who understand why they look so grim and worry or why they have both bring their wand to the match little do harry know that ron and hermione have be secretly practice the curse get the idea from malfoy use it on neville and be ready to use it on snape if he show any sign of want to hurt harry now forget locomotor mortis hermione mutter a ron slip his wand up his sleeve i know ron snap nag back in the locker room wood have take harry aside want to pressure you potter but if we ever need an early capture of the snitch now finish the game before snape can favor hufflepuff too much the whole out there say fred weasley peer out of the door come to watch heart do a somersault dumbledore he say dash to the door to make sure fred wa right there wa no mistaking that silver beard harry could have laugh out loud with relief he wa safe there wa simply no way that snape would dare to try to hurt him if dumbledore wa watch perhaps that wa why snape wa look so angry a the team march onto the field something that ron notice too never see snape look so mean he tell hermione look off ouch someone have poke ron in the back of the head it wa malfoy oh sorry weasley see you there malfoy grin broadly at crabbe and goyle wonder how long go to stay on his broom this time anyone want a bet what about you weasley ron snape have just award hufflepuff a penalty

think they choose people for the gryffindor team say malfoy loudly a few minute later a snape award hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all people they feel sorry for see potter get no parent then the weasleys get no should be on the team longbottom get no brain neville go bright red but turn in his seat to face malfoy worth twelve of you malfoy he stammer malfoy crabbe and goyle howl with

have never smell so sweet he walk over the damp grass relive the last hour in his head which wa a happy gryffindors run to lift him onto their ron and hermione in the distance jump up and down ron cheer through a heavy nosebleed harry have reach the shed he lean against the wooden door and look up at hogwarts with it window glow red in the setting sun gryffindor in the lead do it show snape and speaking of snape a hooded figure come swiftly down the front step of the castle clearly not want to be see it walk a fast a possible toward the forbidden forest victory fade from his mind a he watch he recognize the prowling walk snape sneak into the forest while everyone else wa at wa go on harry jump back on his nimbus two thousand and take off glide silently over the castle he saw snape enter the forest at a run he follow the tree be so thick he see where snape have go he fly in circle lower and lower brush the top branch of tree until he hear voice he glide toward them and land noiselessly in a towering beech tree he climb carefully along one of the branch hold tight to his broomstick try to see through the leaf below in a shadowy clearing stand snape but he alone quirrell

blood on the fall leaf harry saw that hagrid look very worried could a werewolf be kill the unicorn harry ask not fast enough say hagrid not easy ter catch a unicorn powerful magic creature i never

frightenin you an get ta get this do so harry set off into the heart of the forest with malfoy and fang they walk for nearly half an hour deeper and deeper into the forest until the path become almost impossible to follow because the tree be so thick harry think the blood seem to be get thicker there be splash on the root of a tree a though the poor creature have be thrash around in pain close by harry could see a clearing ahead through the tangled branch of an ancient oak look he murmur hold out his arm to stop malfoy something bright white wa gleam on the ground they inch closer it wa the unicorn all right and it wa dead harry have never see anything so beautiful and sad it long slender leg be stick out at odd angle where it have fall and it mane wa spread on the dark leaf harry have take one step toward it when a slithering sound make him freeze where he stand a bush on the edge of the clearing quiver then out of the shadow a hooded figure come crawl across the ground like some stalk beast harry malfoy and fang stand transfixed the cloaked figure reach the unicorn lower it head over the wound in the side and begin to drink it blood aaaaaaaaaargh malfoy let out a terrible scream and do fang the hooded figure raise it head and look right at blood wa dribble down it front it get to it foot and come swiftly toward move for fear then a pain like never felt before pierce his it wa a though his scar be on fire half blind he stagger backward he hear hoof behind him gallop and something jump clean over harry charge at the figure the pain in head wa so bad he fell to his knee it take a minute or two to pas when he look up the figure have go a centaur wa stand over him not ronan or this one look he have hair and a palomino body be you all right say the centaur pull harry to his foot wa that the centaur answer he have astonishingly blue eye like pale sapphire he look carefully at harry his eye linger on the scar that stand out livid on forehead you be the potter boy he say you have better get back to hagrid the forest be not safe at this for you can you ride it will be quicker this way my name be firenze he add a he lower himself on to his front leg so that harry could clamber onto his back there wa suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing ronan and bane come burst through the tree their flank heaving and sweaty firenze bane thunder what be you do you have a human on your back have you no shame be you a common mule do you realize who this be say firenze this be the potter boy the quicker he leaf this forest the better what have you be tell him growled bane remember firenze we be swear not to set ourselves against the heaven have we not read what be to come in the movement of the planet ronan paw the ground nervously sure firenze think he wa act for the best he say in his gloomy voice bane kick his back leg in anger for the best what be that to do with u centaur be concern with what ha be foretold it be not our business to run around like donkey after stray human in our forest firenze suddenly rear on to his hind leg in anger so that harry have to grab his shoulder to stay on do you not see that unicorn firenze bellow at bane do you not understand why it wa kill or have the planet not let you in on that secret i set myself against what be lurk in this forest bane yes with human alongside me if i must and firenze whisk with harry clutch on a best he could they plunge off into the tree leave ronan and bane behind them harry have a clue what wa go on bane so angry he ask what wa that thing you save me from anyway firenze slow to a walk warn harry to keep his head bow in case of branch but do not answer question they make their way through the tree in silence for so long that harry think firenze want to talk to him anymore they be pass through a particularly dense patch of tree however when firenze suddenly stop harry potter do you know what unicorn blood be use for no say harry startle by the odd question only use the horn and tail hair in potion that be because it be a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn say firenze only one who ha nothing to lose and everything to gain would commit such a crime the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you be an inch from death but at a terrible price you have slay something pure and defenseless to save yourself and you will have but a a cursed life from the moment the blood touch your lip harry star at the back of head which wa dapple silver in the moonlight but be that desperate he wonder aloud if go to be curse forever death better it it be firenze agree unless all you need be to stay alive long enough to drink something that will bring you back to full strength and that will mean you can never die mr potter do you know what be hide in the school at this very moment the stone of elixir of life but i understand who can you think of nobody who ha wait many year to return to power who ha clung to life await their chance it wa a though an iron fist have clench suddenly around heart over the rustling of the tree he seem to hear once more what hagrid have tell him on the night they have some say he die codswallop in my opinion dunno if he have enough human leave in him to die do you mean harry croak that wa vol harry harry be you all right hermione wa run toward them down the path hagrid puff along behind her fine say harry hardly know what he wa say the dead hagrid in that clear back there this be where i leave you firenze murmur a hagrid hurry off to examine the unicorn you be safe now harry slide off his back good luck harry potter say firenze the planet have be read wrongly before now even by centaur i hope this be one of those time he turn and canter back into the depth of the forest leaving harry shiver behind him ron have fall asleep in the dark common room wait for them to return he shout something about quidditch foul when harry roughly shake him awake in a matter of second though he wa a harry begin to tell him and hermione what have happen in the forest harry sit down he pace up and down in front of the fire he wa still shake snape want the stone for voldemort and wait in the forest and all this time we think snape just want to get rich stop say the name say ron in a terrified whisper a if he think voldemort could hear them harry listen firenze save me but he have do so bane wa furious he wa talk about interfere with what the planet say be go to happen they must show that come back bane think firenze should have let voldemort kill me i suppose write in the star a well will you stop say the name ron hiss so all get to wait for now be snape to steal the stone harry go on feverishly then voldemort will be able to come and finish me off well i suppose be happy hermione look very frightened but she have a word of comfort harry everyone say the only one wa ever afraid of with dumbledore around touch you anyway who say the centaur be right it sound like to me and professor mcgonagall say a very imprecise branch of magic the sky have turn light before they stop talk they go to bed exhaust their throat sore but the surprise over when harry pull back his sheet he find his invisibility cloak fold neatly underneath them there wa a note pin to just in case chapter sixteen through the trapdoor in year to come harry would never quite remember how he have manage to get through his exam when he half expect voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment yet the day creep by and there could be no doubt that fluffy wa still alive and well behind the locked door it wa swelter hot especially in the large classroom where they do their write paper they have be give special new quill for the exam which have be bewitch with an anticheating spell they have practical exam a well professor flitwick call them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk professor mcgonagall watch them turn a mouse into a be give for how pretty the snuffbox wa but take away if it have whisker snape make them all nervous breathe down their neck while they try to remember how to make a forgetfulness potion harry do the best he could try to ignore the stab pain in his forehead which have be bother him ever since his trip into the forest neville thought harry have a bad case of exam nerve because harry sleep but the truth wa that harry keep be wake by his old nightmare except that it wa now worse than ever because there wa a hooded figure drip blood in it maybe it wa because they see what harry have see in the forest or because they have scar burn on their forehead but ron and hermione seem a worried about the stone a harry the idea of voldemort certainly scar them but he keep visit them in dream and they be so busy with their study they have much time to fret about what snape or anyone else might be up to their very last exam wa history of magic one hour of answer question about batty old wizard invent selfstirring cauldron and be free free for a whole wonderful week until their exam result come out when the ghost of professor binns tell them to put down their quill and roll up their parchment harry help cheer with the rest that wa far easier than i think it would be say hermione a they join the crowd flock out onto the sunny ground i have learn about the werewolf code of conduct or the uprising of elfric the eager hermione always like to go through their exam paper afterward but ron say this make him feel ill so they wander down to the lake and flop under a tree the weasley twin and lee jordan be tickle the tentacle of a giant squid which wa bask in the warm shallow no more studying ron sigh happily stretch out on the grass you could look more cheerful harry get a week before we find out how badly do no need to worry yet harry wa rub his forehead i wish i know what this mean he burst out angrily my scar keep happen before but never a often a this go to madam pomfrey hermione suggest not ill say harry i think a warning it mean come ron get work up it wa too hot harry relax right the safe a long a around anyway never have any proof snape find out how to get past fluffy he nearly have his leg rip off once not go to try it again in a hurry and neville will play quidditch for england before hagrid let dumbledore down harry nodded but he shake off a lurk feeling that there wa something forgotten to do something important when he try to explain this hermione say just the exam i wake up last night and wa halfway through my transfiguration note before i remember do that one harry wa quite sure the unsettled feeling have anything to do with work though he watch an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky a note clamp in it mouth hagrid wa the only one who ever send him letter hagrid would never betray dumbledore hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past fluffy never but harry suddenly jump to his foot you go say ron sleepily just think of something say harry he have turn white get to go and see hagrid now why pant hermione hurry to keep up you think a bit odd say harry scramble up the grassy slope that what hagrid want more than anything else be a dragon and a stranger turn up who just happen to have an egg in his pocket how many people wander around with dragon egg if against wizard law lucky they find hagrid you think why i see it before what be you talk about say ron but harry sprint across the ground toward the forest answer hagrid wa sit in an armchair outside his his trouser and sleeve be roll up and he wa

he join her by the wall wipe sweat off his face yeah say ron and lucky harry lose his head in a no wood honestly this way say harry point down a stone passageway which wa the only way forward all they could hear apart from their footstep wa the gentle drip of water trickle down the wall the passageway slop downward and harry wa remind of gringotts with an unpleasant jolt of the heart he remember the dragon say to be guard vault in the wizard bank if they meet a dragon a have be bad enough can you hear something ron whisper harry listen a soft rustling and clinking seem to be come from up ahead do you think a ghost i know sound like wing to me light can see something move they reach the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber it ceiling arch high above them it wa full of small bird fluttering and tumble all around the room on the opposite side of the chamber wa a heavy wooden door do you think attack u if we cross the room say ron probably say harry they look very vicious but i suppose if they all swoop down at once well no other choice run he take a deep breath cover his face with his arm and sprint across the room he expect to feel sharp beak and claw tearing at him any second but nothing happen he reach the door untouched he pull the handle but it wa lock the other two follow him they tug and heave at the door but it budge not even when hermione try her alohomora charm now what say ron these bird they be here just for decoration say hermione they watch the bird soar overhead not bird harry say suddenly key wing carefully so that must mean he look around the chamber while the other two squint up at the flock of key broomstick get to catch the key to the door but there be hundred of them ron examine the lock on the door look for a big silver like the handle they each seize a broomstick and kick off into the air soar into the midst of the cloud of key they grab and snatch but the bewitch key dart and dive so quickly it wa almost impossible to catch one not for nothing though wa harry the youngest seeker in a century he have a knack for spot thing other people after a weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feather he notice a large silver key that have a bent wing a if it have already be catch and stuff roughly into the keyhole that one he call to the others that big bright blue feather be all crumple on one side ron go speed in the direction that harry wa point crash into the ceiling and nearly fell off his broom get to close in on it harry call not take his eye off the key with the damage wing ron you come at it from stay below and stop it from go down and try and catch it right now ron dive hermione rocket upward the key dodge them both and harry streak after it speed toward the wall harry lean forward and with a nasty crunching noise pin it against the stone with one hand ron and cheer echoed around the high chamber they land quickly and harry ran to the door the key struggle in his hand he ram it into the lock and work the moment the lock have click open the key take flight again look very batter now that it have be catch twice ready harry ask the other two his hand on the door handle they nod he pull the door open the next chamber wa so dark they see anything at all but a they step into it light suddenly flood the room to reveal an astonishing sight they be stand on the edge of a huge chessboard behind the black chessman which be all taller than they be and carve from what look like black stone face them way across the chamber be the white piece harry ron and hermione shiver tower
